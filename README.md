# Game Development project using SDL2

This is a small game developement project done with the purpose of practincing and improving my C skills and familiarizing with the SDL2 library.

Compile with:
```
gcc main.c init.c draw.c input.c `sdl2-config --libs --cflags` -ggdb3 -O0 --std=c99 -Wall -lSDL2_image -lm
```

Currently, the game looks like this
